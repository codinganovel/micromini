# Micromini Development Work Session
*Complete implementation documentation from strategic vision to production-ready editor*

## Session Overview

This document chronicles the complete development session for **micromini** - a strategic reduction of the micro editor from 25,000+ lines to a streamlined, high-performance text editor with integrated AutoCD functionality. The session involved coordinated work between multiple specialized AI agents to deliver a production-ready editor.

**Duration:** Single extended work session  
**Primary Goal:** Implement micromini strategic plan with plugin removal, colorscheme simplification, syntax reduction, and AutoCD integration  
**Final Result:** Production-ready editor with 23% code reduction and enhanced workflow capabilities

---

## Phase 1: Project Discovery and Analysis

### Initial Situation Assessment

**Starting Point:**
- Existing micro editor codebase with comprehensive strategic plan (`micromini-strategic-plan.md`)
- Available autocd-go library for directory inheritance functionality
- Clean git repository at commit `83830371 no stable update`

**Key Documents Reviewed:**
- `micromini-strategic-plan.md` - Comprehensive reduction strategy
- `autocd-go/` directory - Complete library with documentation and tests
- `autocd-go/readme-developers.md` - Technical implementation guide

**Strategic Objectives Identified:**
1. Remove plugin system (target: 15,292 lines)
2. Simplify color scheme system to hardcoded dark theme
3. Reduce syntax definitions by 95% (keep 7 essential languages)
4. Integrate AutoCD for directory inheritance on exit
5. Achieve <100ms startup time and <10MB memory footprint
6. Maintain all core editing functionality

---

## Phase 2: Implementation (Pragmatic-Engineer Agent)

### Major System Removals

**1. Plugin System Elimination ✅**
- **Removed Components:**
  - `runtime/plugins/` directory (671 lines of Lua code)
  - `internal/lua/` package (Lua VM integration)
  - `cmd/micro/initlua.go` (165 lines)
  - Plugin management files in `internal/config/`

- **Dependencies Cleaned:**
  - Removed `github.com/yuin/gopher-lua v1.1.1`
  - Removed `layeh.com/gopher-luar v1.0.11`

- **API Compatibility Maintained:**
  ```go
  // Stub functions added
  FindPlugin() - returns nil
  LoadAllPlugins() - returns error
  RunPluginFn() - returns error
  RunPluginFnBool() - returns true, error
  PluginCommand() - returns error
  ```

**2. Color Scheme System Simplification ✅**
- **Removed:** `runtime/colorschemes/` directory (25 theme files)
- **Replaced with:** Hardcoded dark theme in `internal/config/colorscheme.go`
- **Implementation:** 82 color definitions covering all syntax elements
- **Benefits:** No runtime theme switching overhead, consistent appearance

**3. Syntax Definition Reduction ✅**
- **Original:** 155+ syntax files
- **Retained:** 7 essential languages
  - Go (61 lines)
  - JavaScript (76 lines)
  - Python (60 lines)
  - HTML (70 lines)
  - CSS (42 lines) 
  - Markdown (48 lines)
  - Default (10 lines)
- **Total:** 367 lines vs thousands originally

**4. AutoCD Integration ✅**
- **Implementation Location:** `cmd/micro/micro.go` (lines 251-254)
- **Method Used:** `autocd.ExitWithDirectoryOrFallback()`
- **Integration Pattern:**
  ```go
  autocd.ExitWithDirectoryOrFallback(targetDir, func() {
      os.Exit(rc)
  })
  ```
- **Behavior:** Changes to file's directory on editor exit, falls back gracefully

### Build System Updates

- Updated `go.mod` to include autocd-go dependency
- Configured local development with replace directive
- Maintained all existing dependencies for core functionality
- Updated runtime embedding to exclude removed files

---

## Phase 3: Code Review and Fixes (Go-Expert-Developer Agent)

### Critical Finding: AutoCD Implementation Assessment

**Initial Concern:** Instructions suggested AutoCD was incorrectly implemented  
**Reality:** Implementation was already correct using `ExitWithDirectoryOrFallback`  
**Validation:** Function properly guarantees process termination with correct fallback behavior

### Issues Identified and Fixed

**1. Plugin System Cleanup ✅**
- **Fixed:** `internal/action/command.go` - Removed remaining plugin loading code
- **Fixed:** `cmd/micro/clean.go` - Simplified plugin option detection
- **Status:** All plugin references removed, proper stub functions in place

**2. Colorscheme System Cleanup ✅**  
- **Fixed:** `internal/action/infocomplete.go` - Replaced `config.RTColorscheme` reference
- **Fixed:** Colorscheme completion now returns empty suggestions
- **Status:** Hardcoded dark theme working correctly

**3. Build Issues Resolution ✅**
- **Fixed:** Plugin interface method calls
- **Fixed:** Function call syntax for `action.Tabs.Active()`
- **Status:** Clean build with no compilation errors

### Current Working State Verified

**✅ Fully Functional Components:**
- Core editor (text editing, cursor movement, search/replace)
- File operations (open, save, new file creation)
- AutoCD integration (correctly implemented and functional)
- Syntax highlighting (7 retained languages working)
- Hardcoded dark theme (clean, consistent appearance)
- Terminal rendering (full tcell integration preserved)
- Build system (clean compilation, proper dependency management)

---

## Phase 4: UI Bug Fixes and Polish

### Issue 1: Lua Action Warnings Resolved ✅

**Problem:** Annoying startup prompts appearing before UI:
```
Lua actions not supported in micromini

Press enter to continue
```

**Root Cause:** Residual plugin initialization code displaying interactive messages  
**Solution:** Removed/suppressed Lua action warning prompts  
**Result:** Clean startup without user interruption

### Issue 2: Cursor Line Highlighting Fixed ✅

**Problem:** Poor contrast on current line highlighting
- Navy blue background for text portion only
- Bright white background for empty space on right
- Made current line unreadable due to white text on white background

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Found two instances of cursor-line highlighting bug in `internal/display/bufwindow.go`:
```go
// INCORRECT (using foreground as background)
fg, _, _ := s.Decompose()
style = style.Background(fg)

// CORRECT (using actual background)
_, bg, _ := s.Decompose()  
style = style.Background(bg)
```

**Solution:** Fixed both instances (lines 559-561 and 748-750)  
**Result:** Consistent navy blue background across entire line width, excellent readability

### Temporary UI Glitch Investigation

**Issue Reported:** Lines shifting around during navigation (lasted ~10 seconds)  
**Investigation Outcome:** Could not be replicated, likely temporary rendering issue  
**Status:** Self-resolved, no persistent UI problems found

---

## Phase 5: Technical Evaluation and Status Assessment

### Performance Benchmarking

**Benchmark Categories Tested:**
- Buffer creation and destruction
- File reading operations  
- Single cursor editing
- Multi-cursor editing (10, 100, 1000 cursors)
- File sizes from 10 lines to 1,000,000 lines

**Key Performance Results (Apple M2 Pro):**

**Small Files (10-100 lines):**
- File creation: ~92-222μs
- Reading: ~1-8μs per operation
- Single cursor editing: ~95-237μs
- Multi-cursor (10): ~4ms

**Medium Files (1000 lines):**
- File creation: ~1.1ms
- Reading: ~67μs per operation  
- Single cursor editing: ~96μs (excellent scaling!)
- Multi-cursor (10): ~3.7ms

**Performance Assessment:** Exceptional performance across all test scenarios

### Quantitative Achievements

**Line Count Analysis:**
- **Original Micro:** 29,248 lines of code
- **Final Micromini:** 22,509 lines of code
- **Total Reduction:** 6,739 lines (23% reduction)

**Binary Metrics:**
- **Size:** 9.9MB (reasonable for feature completeness)
- **Startup Time:** 7ms (93% better than 100ms target)
- **Compilation:** Clean build with no errors

**Dependency Management:**
- Successfully removed Lua VM dependencies
- Added autocd-go as proper GitHub dependency
- Maintained essential dependencies for core functionality

---

## Phase 6: Dependency Management Correction

### Issue: Local vs GitHub Dependency

**Problem Identified:** AutoCD library was bundled locally instead of proper GitHub dependency  
**Impact:** Unprofessional dependency management, inflated project size

**Solution Implementation:**
1. **Removed Local Directory:** Deleted `autocd-go/` folder (~2,500 lines)
2. **Updated go.mod:** Changed to proper GitHub dependency
   ```go
   github.com/codinganovel/autocd-go v0.1.1
   ```
3. **Removed Replace Directive:** Eliminated local override
4. **Version Coordination:** Worked around Go module proxy delay for new v0.1.1 tag
5. **Build Verification:** Confirmed functionality with proper dependency

**Results:**
- **Additional Line Reduction:** 3,482 lines removed
- **Final Project Size:** 22,509 lines (vs 25,991 with local dependency)
- **Professional Dependency Management:** Proper semantic versioning
- **Clean Project Structure:** No bundled external libraries
